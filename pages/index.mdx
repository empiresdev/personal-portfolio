# About me

<img src="images/profile-circle.png" alt="Eduardo's profile picture" width="150"/>


Experienced software engineer with a strong background in mobile cross-platform development, product management and innovation consulting. With over 10 years of industry experience, I have a proven track record of delivering impactful solutions to common problems through innovative software development.

I have successfully developed mobile applications using the former Titanium Mobile (Javascript) and Flutter (Dart), both including native Android (Java/Kotlin) modules. I thrive in dynamic environments that challenge me to think creatively and find sustainable solutions.

As co-founder, in 2012, I led the development of a mobile payment startup from the ground up, leveraging Titanium Mobile (Javascript), Java EE and Python on Google Cloud Platform. I have also excelled in roles such as Product Manager and Innovation Consultant, collaborating with cross-functional teams to drive product and business success.
